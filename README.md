# NavMeshExampleProject

This project is a navigation project that I started to test the usage of Unity's NavMeshSurface and associated NavMesh tools for an upcoming RPG game project I am working on.  This leverages a large portion from Brackey's NavMesh tutorial here:

I modified this to add a "clickable area" for each turn's worth of movement that would be allowed for each NavMeshAgent in the scene.  NavMesh is a relatively elegant way to manage navigatable surfaces within a Unity 3d landscape.

This project was built in Unity 2019.2.12f1.
